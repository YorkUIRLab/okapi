a cement retarder The polymer is obtainable by copolymerization of a monomer including maleic anhydride with a monomer including a vinylalkyl ether-series monomer in which an alkylene oxide is added to allyl alcohol The polymer may be a copolymer copolymerized with other monomers such as styrene Use of this cement retarder can provide patterns or washing-finished face on the surface of a concrete product The cement retarder is suitable for application for a cement retardative sheet  The present invention relates to a cement retarder a cement-hardening retardant a method for retarding the hardening or setting of a cement using the cement retarder a cement retardative sheet as produced using the retarder a decorative dressing kit sheet comprising the cement retardative sheet and a method for producing a dressing-finished concrete product with using the cement retardative sheet or the decorative kit sheet A cement retarder is a kind of a cement admixture a cement additive and used for retardation of a hydration reaction of a cement thereby retarding the setting or hardening of a mortar or concrete As disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No 172250 1989 JP-A-1-172250 conventional cement retarders can be roughly classified into two categories organic cement retarders and inorganic cement retarders The inorganic retarders include lead oxide boron oxide borax zinc chloride zinc oxide magnasium silicofluoride and the like The organic retarders include sugar a salt of an oxycarboxylic acid a salt of lignosulfonic acid gluconic acid or its salt pyruvic acid -ketoglutaric acid and other keto acids and so on These cement retarders are used mainly for longer hours of transportation of ready-mixed concrete in the summer season and for mitigation of stress due to a temperature heat held in a large-sized concrete structure The surfaces of concrete products and various buildings are frequently decorated by means of washing washing finish technology of plastering technologies The washing finish technology comprises washing a surface of a concrete product with water just before the hardening of a cement so that the mortar on the concrete surface can be washed out thereby exposing a part of aggregates on the surface The washing operation has to be carried out in a strictly limited time period because the timing for the washing operation is closely linked to the rate of the concrete hardening Concrete products produced by the precast technology are prevailing these days and a wall member a wall material a concrete slab for pavement decoration and the like decorated by washing-finishing are manufactured in the factories Regrettably it is difficult to conduct a timely washing operation although the rationalisation of production steps is of significant importance for this industry Therefore it is advantageous if the moulding step of the concrete slab and the washing step of the cement can be separated so that the washing step can be operated irrespective of the hardening or setting degree of the cement By applying a cement-hardening retarder which is a kind of a cement admixture a cement additive on the surface of a concrete product for retardation of the hardening of the concrete surface layer the concrete surface can be washed out for decoration regardless of the hardening rate of the cement By way of illustration Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No 47725 1994 JP-A-6-47725 suggests a process which comprises the steps of coating the inner surface of a mould with an aqueous solution containing a conventional cement retarder and a thickener in advance depositing casting a concrete in the mould removing the hardened article therefrom and washing out the surface of the article Japanese Patent

is to be washed out on the surface of the concrete product A concrete is cast and set in the mould which is removed after hardening The unhardened or unset mortar on the surface of the concrete product where the retardative sheet was fixed is washed away to give a concrete product with surface decoration surface dressing Since the cement retarder is contained or retained in the base sheet the retarder does not move or flow in casting a concrete Besides the cement retarder does not run or flow away due to bleed water as the retarder has a limited solubility in water As a result decorative patterns such as letters and figures can be laid clearly and precisely on a predetermined area of the surface of a concrete product or building The cement retardative sheet may be whichever of a non-tacky adhesive non-pressure sensitive adhesive or non-adhesive sheet or a tacky adhesive sheet which is made adhesive by incorporating a tacky adhesive agent or an adhesive agent hereinafter

adhesive properties due to the tacky adhesive agent is effective for the production of a concrete product which has patterns figures or a washed face on its surface and on which a decorative member is fixed in a body in a mass To give a specific example the retardative sheet is laid in a mould with the adhesive surface facing upwards The front faces of plural decorative or dressing members such as stones and tiles are disposed stuck onto the sheet and thus the decorative members are fixed on a predetermined position An inorganic hardenable composition is cast or deposited in the mould which is hardened by curing or other conventional hardening methods and then the hardened article is taken out of the mould By removing the retardative sheet and washing the revealed surface the surface in contact with the sheet of the decorative member with using water pressurised water jet flow or the like the unhardened or unset composition adhering to the decorative member is easily removed Removal of the tacky adhesive agent provides a concrete product on which cleaned decorative members are fixed e g a dressed block a precast concrete slab If no decorative member is adhered to the tacky adhesive surface of the sheet the washing process provides a pattern or washed-out surface where aggregates are exposed In the cement retardative sheet the coating layer containing the cement retarder may be peelable from the base sheet If this is the case a washing-finished surface with a pattern a figure or exposed aggregates is produced in the following process A predetermined section or area of the coating layer is cut into a desired pattern and peeled off from the base sheet The retardative sheet is laid down in a mould into which an inorganic hardenable curable composition e g a mortar composition is cast or deposited The surface of the cured and hardened concrete product in contact with the sheet was subjected to washing-finish thus giving a washing-finished surface on which the intended decoration is exposed according to the section of the remaining coating layer the layer not having been cut off or peeled off from the base sheet In order to make the coating layer peelable the surface of the base sheet may be left untreated or may be treated with a releasing agent such as a wax a higher fatty acid amide or a silicon oil The surface tension of the base sheet is selected in relation to the adhesive strength of the coating layer within a range not losing the peeling properties of the coating layer For instance the surface tension of the base sheet is not higher than about 38 dyne cm preferably about 20 to 38 dyne cm and more preferably about 25 to 36 dyne cm When the retardative sheet whose surface is imparted with tacky adhesive properties e g a sheet provided with the coating layer or hardening retardative layer containing the tacky adhesive is employed a kit sheet where decorative materials are arranged or disposed beforehand on the tacky adhesive layer may be laid in the mould instead of arranging the decorative materials therein By way of illustration a unit tile can be formed by laying side by side or scattering plural tiles as decorative materials onto the tacky coating layer in the surface direction The plural tiles may practically be arranged adjacently side by side or with intervals in the surface direction e g in a longitudinal direction a transverse direction cross direction or in both longitudinal and transverse directions The use of the decorative kit sheet insures an improved working efficiency as this saves the process of arranging decorative members one by one into the mould the tiresome process being replaced by a simple process of laying in the mould a decorative kit sheet prepared in another independent step As the decorative members use can be made of a variety of materials such as boulders or cobblestones black stones Teppei stones and other naturally-occurring stones artificial stones and other stones tiles and other ceramic materials metallic materials glass wood woven fabrics and others The decorative material may be in the form of a flat plate and the tile may be a mosaic tile or a divided tile In the production of the concrete product a reinforcing steel or other reinforcements reinforcing materials may be arranged in a mould if necessary for the casting or deposit of the inorganic hardenable composition The decorative kit film such as the unit tile is advantageous for the production of a precast concrete slab and other dressing-finished faced concrete products A precast concrete slab decorated with a dressing member tightly adhered thereto is produced by the following procedures A decorative kit sheet is disposed in the concrete casting mould with the reverse surface back of the tile or other decorative members facing upwards A concrete is cast and then cured After the hardened article is taken out of the mould the tacky adhesive sheet is removed whereby the surface of the decorative member is exposed The surface is washed with water in order to wash away the unhardened or unset inorganic hardenable composition e g cement which has reached the surface of the decorative member thus giving the precast concrete slab provided with a decorative or dressing member fixed thereon According to this process even when the inorganic hardenable composition has reached the surface of the tile or the decorative member its hardening can be prevented owing to the action of the cement retarder Since the inorganic hardenable composition remains to be unhardened partially hardened or not hardened at all the surface-finishing of the decorative member for removal of the inorganic hardenable composition is conducted efficiently and perfectly in a simple washing operation such as washing with water The cement includes for instance an air-hardening cement e g gypsum plaster slaked lime dolomite plaster and other limes and a hydraulic cement e g Portland cement high-early-strength Portland cement alumina cement rapid-hardening high-strength cement calcined gypsum and other self hardening cements lime slag cement blast-furnace-cement cement mixtures The preferable cement includes gypsum dolomite plaster and hydraulic cements typically speaking The cement may be used as a paste composition cement paste with water or used as a mortar composition or concrete composition containing sand quartz sand pearlite or other fine aggregates and or coarse aggregates The paste composition and the mortar composition may contain as necessary any of various additives such as colouring agents hardening agents calcium chloride and other hardening accelerators sodium naphthalene-sulfonate and other water reducing agents coagulants carboxymethyl cellulose methyl cellulose poly vinyl alcohol and other thickeners foaming agents synthetic resin emulsions and other waterproof agents plasticisers and so on The cement retarder and the cement retardative sheet of the present invention are useful for production of various concrete products such as a curtain wall a wall member and other concrete panels slabs and concrete blocks and above all for the manufacture of dressing-finished concrete products e g precast concrete slabs The cement retarder of the present invention which comprises a polymer having the anionic group and the hydrophilic segment insures high hardening-retarding properties hardening-retardancy for a long period of time The elution of the retarder caused by water can be prevented by a proper selection of the anionic group and the hydrophilic segment According to the hardening-retarding method using this cement retarder decorative patterns can be formed on the surface of the concrete product with high precision by the washing-finish technology The cement retardative sheet the cement hardening-retarding sheet of the present invention is useful for the formation of a decorative pattern on a predetermined area of the concrete product The following examples are intended to describe the present invention in further detail and should by no means be interpreted as defining the scope of the invention Fed in a
